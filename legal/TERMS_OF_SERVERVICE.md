**Nexit Security** (“Nexit”, “the Bot”, “we”, “us”, “our”)

**Effective Date:** 2026-02-03

## 1) Acceptance of these Terms
By inviting, using, or interacting with Nexit Security (the “Bot”) in any Discord server, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Bot.

## 2) Who can use the Bot
You must follow Discord’s Terms, Community Guidelines, and your local laws. If you are not allowed to use Discord, you are not allowed to use the Bot.

## 3) What the Bot does
Nexit Security provides moderation and server-management features, which may include:
- Moderation actions (e.g., warnings, timeouts, kicks, bans)
- Anti-spam and anti-raid protections
- Logging features (if enabled by server staff)
- Utility commands (status, uptime, server info, etc.)

Features may change over time.

## 4) Server Admin Responsibility
Server owners and admins are responsible for:
- Configuring permissions correctly
- Ensuring the Bot has only the permissions it needs
- Deciding what moderation actions to take and how the Bot is used in their server
The Bot is a tool; you are responsible for how you use it.

## 5) Premium Features
Some features may be marked as “Premium” (e.g., boosted support server perks or manual premium). Premium features may change, be updated, or be removed at any time.

- Attempt to exploit, reverse engineer, or disrupt the Bot
- Use the Bot for malicious automation (raids, spam, token theft, etc.)

We may restrict access if we believe the Bot is being misused.

## 8) Availability and Changes
The Bot is provided “as-is” and “as available.” We do not guarantee uptime, reliability, or that it will work perfectly on every device/account at all times.

We may update, modify, or discontinue the Bot (or parts of it) at any time.

## 9) Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for:
- Lost messages, deleted content, or moderation actions
- Any damages arising from using or being unable to use the Bot
