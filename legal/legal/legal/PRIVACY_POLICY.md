# Privacy Policy
**Nexit Security** (“Nexit”, “the Bot”, “we”, “us”, “our”)

**Effective Date:** 2026-02-03

## 1) What this policy covers
This Privacy Policy explains what data the Bot may process, why, and how it’s used when you interact with Nexit Security in Discord servers.

## 2) Data we may collect/process
Depending on which features are enabled, the Bot may process and/or store:
- **User IDs** (for moderation records like warnings, whitelist, premium flags)
- **Server (Guild) IDs** (to store server configuration such as log channels/settings)
- **Channel IDs** (for configured logging channels or feature settings)
- **Moderation records** (e.g., warnings: moderator ID, target user ID, reason, timestamps, optional expiration)
- **Invite protection entries** (invite codes marked as protected, optional notes)
- **Anti-spam tracking (temporary)** (short-lived message timing counts used to detect spam)

### What we do NOT intentionally collect
- We do not ask for passwords
- We do not store your Discord token
- We do not intentionally store message content as a general database feature  
  (Some features may *process* message content in-memory to detect spam or blocked mentions.)

## 3) Why we use the data
We use the data to:
- Provide moderation features (warn, timeout, ban, logging)
- Apply server settings (log channel, anti-spam config, invite protection)
- Prevent abuse and keep servers safe (anti-spam/anti-raid features)
- Support premium features and role checks

## 4) Where data is stored
Data is stored in a database used by the Bot (commonly SQLite or a hosted database), controlled by the Bot operator.

## 5) Data retention
We keep data only as long as needed for the features you use:
- Server settings: retained until changed or the Bot is removed
- Warnings: retained until removed/expired (if expiration is enabled)
- Temporary anti-spam tracking: short-lived and not intended as long-term storage

## 6) Sharing your data
We do not sell your data. We only share data if:
- Required by law, legal process, or to protect users from harm/abuse
- Needed to operate the Bot with trusted infrastructure providers (hosting), where applicable

## 7) Security
We take reasonable steps to protect stored data, but no system is 100% secure. You use the Bot at your own risk.

## 8) Your choices and controls
Server admins control most data by controlling features:
- Removing warnings
- Clearing warnings
- Disabling logging
- Removing the Bot from the server (stops future collection)

## 9) Requests (Deletion / Questions)
If you want data removed (where applicable) or have questions:
- Contact us through the official support server or the listed contact method.
Include your **User ID** and the **Server ID** involved so we can find the correct records.

## 10) Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy. Continued use of the Bot after changes means you accept the updated policy.
